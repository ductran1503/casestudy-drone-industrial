	\section{Summary} \textcolor{red}{a Modifier - add image- shorter}
	\paragraph{}In order to monitor a nuclear power plant, the electricity company will use a UAS equipped with a thermal camera. The UAS will be deployed to make flights around the plant which locates in a rural zone. The drone does not fly across the plant and keep the distance of 200m from the plant. There is not any airport near the inspected area. The drones is 30 kg with the maximun dimension of 2m is designed to fly automatically and  beyond visual line of pilot during the whole operation at 30m above the ground. 
	
	\paragraph{}During the flight, the pilot observes the status of the drone and the highway in real time via the GCS computer. The pilot needs to carry out only three simple actions: start the flight, end the flight (back to stand by mode), go home. The data exchanged between the GCS and the aircraft is transmitted via a wireless communication system.
	
	\paragraph {} The aircraft is equipped with a video camera with the characteristics as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Resolution: 1920 x 1080
		\item Min. Angle of view: 140 degree.

	\item After the flight, the pilot turns off the UAV. The pilot is in charge of carrying out the post analyses of the data stored on the GCS.
	\item After the flight, the second pilot checks for any damage, wear or tear before taking the UAV back to store. The support staff is in charge of carrying out the post analyses of the data stored on the UAV.
	\item Both the pilot and the second pilot are in charge of completing the post analysis report and report any technical anomalies to the manufacturer. 
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection {UAS Configuration Management} \textcolor{red}{a Modifier}
	\paragraph{} Any changes to the hardware and the software(parameter configuration, flight plan modification, software update) are designed or created by the manufacturer.
	\paragraph{} Any changes to the UAS are carried out by the manufacturer. The instructions and equipment for this task are defined and documented by the manufacturer. 
	\paragraph{} The log system is used to record all changes conducted on UAS.
	
	\subsection{Operational procedure description} \textcolor{red}{a Modifier}
	\paragraph{}To observe the nuclear power plant, the owner company deploy a unmanned aircraft. The aircraft will fly around the plant. 
	
	\paragraph{} The drone of 30kg is designed to fly automatically and  beyond visual line of pilot during the whole operation at 30m above the ground. The flights is made inside a predefined geographic zone of100 large around the plant (geo-fencing). The distance between the flight zone and the plan is 200m. \textcolor{red}{a Modifier- add image}
	
	\paragraph{}During the flight, the pilots could observe the status of the drone and the plant via the GCS computers. The pilot could perform only three simple actions: start the flight, end the flight (back to stand by mode), go home. 
	
	\subsubsection{Standard operating procedures}
	\paragraph{Pre-flight procedures}
	\subparagraph{Operating site location} : The flight area (sky and land) is checked in order to ensure that a safety flight could be carried out:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Other aircraft operations: Check to see if there are any other aircraft 
		operations within the immediate vicinity such as local aerodromes, sky 
		diving sites etc.
		\item Public Access: Is there any public access to the site and surrounding 
		areas? What is the likelihood of encountering a member of the public?
		\item Weather conditions: The weather will be checked on the day of the flight as well as whenthe pilot arrives on site. If at anytimethe pilot feelsthat the weather could jeopardisethe safety of the flight he has the right to cancel/abort the operation. 
		\item Pre-notification: it will be necessary to notify any nearby Aerodrome and aircraft operating sites or the local police of any operations that we are undertaking. If the	flight is being conducted in or near Aerodrome traffic then notification must be given beforethe event to ensurethat the flight wonâ€™t have an impact on the operations of said Aerodrome.
	\end{itemize} 
	
	\subparagraph{Preparation and correct assembly of UAV}: the UAVs are unpacked from the store and set up in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions.
	
	\subparagraph{Pre-flight checks on UAS and equipment} Once the UAV has been unpacked and assembled, the support staff will give the devicce one final check before the flight to confirm that there are no defects that were missed or that were caused during transit or conservation. Then the pilot starts the GCS and checks the value of displayed parameters, flight map for any anomalies. 
	These checks are defined in a checklist provided by manufacturer. 
	
	\paragraph{Flight procedures}
	
	\subparagraph{Take-off}
	\paragraph{} Once all the pre-flight checks have been completed, the pilot starts the flight by pushing the 'takeoff' button on GCS. Receiving the command of the pilot, the UAV automatically takes off and fly up to the altitude of 30m. 
	\paragraph{} During takeoff, the UAV is observed by both the pilot and the support staff.
	
	\subparagraph{In-flight}
	\paragraph{} After reaching up the 30m altitude, the UAV follows the predefined trajectory in order to capture the video of highway.
	\paragraph{} The pilot concentrates on monitoring the flight status (attitude, altitude, batteries, position) and monitoring the high-way.  
	\paragraph{} The support staff concentrate on visually monitoring the flight on the field.
	
	\subparagraph{Landing} 
	\paragraph{} Once the predefined trajectory is completed, the UAV goes back the landing site and hover over ground at 150m. Then it automatically lands on the ground. Once the landing is completed, the pilot pushes the 'dis-arm' button in order to turn off all the motors. Then the support staff turn off the power of the UAV.
	\paragraph{} During landing, the UAV is observed by both the pilot and the support staff.
	
	\paragraph{Post-flight}
	\paragraph{} Once a flight has been completed the time of flight must be logged. This will include the start and end times of the flight and the duration. Also any incidents must be noted and logged.
	\paragraph{} Then the UAV is inspected for signs of wear and tear or damage. If any is found it must be recorded.
    \paragraph{} All the flight data and video data stored on the UAV will be downloaded. 
    \paragraph{} All flight data (store on the GCS and the UAV) will be analyzed by the pilot and the support staff. Any incidents must be noted, logged and reported to the manufacturer.
    
    \subsubsection{Abnormal operation and emergency procedures}
	\subparagraph{Malfunctions}
	\paragraph{} If any malfunction (communication, sensor, battery, controller,etc) is detected on the UAV then steps must be taken to immediately land the device safely at one of the designated landing sites. If the malfunction make a controlled landing is unavailable, the pilot must shutdown all motors and let the UAV drop within flight zone. In order to protect the people on the ground and the aircraft, the aircraft is equiped with a parachute which could be automatically or manually deployed.    
	\paragraph{} A list of possible malfunction and necessary procedures are documented and provided by manufacturer.  
	\subparagraph{Lost of control}
	\paragraph{} In the case that the aircraft is totally lost of control and the auto fail-safe function is failed, the pilot could stop the operation manually by push the fail-safe button.
	\subparagraph{Change in Weather}
	\paragraph{} During the flight the weather must be monitored at all times. If the pilot feels that rain or snow is imminent then he will take steps to return the UAV to the designated landing zone
	\subparagraph{Fire}
	\paragraph{} In the event of smoke or fire coming from the UAV the pilot must immediately return to the landing zone to assess the cause and severity of the incident.In the case of damage or fire to the battery a fire blanket must be used to cover the UAV and control the fire
	\subparagraph{Designated Landing Area Compromised }
	\paragraph{}In the event that the designated landing area is compromised the pilot will land the UAV at the secondary site. If both sites are compromised the support staff will try to clear the obstruction to allow the pilot to safely land
